ΔXpress: A tool for mapping differentially correlated genes using  single-cell qPCR data

We present deltaXpress (ΔXpress), a web app for analyzing data from single-cell qPCR experiments using a combination of HTML and R programming languages in a friendly environment. This application uses cycle threshold (Ct) values and categorical information for each sample as input, allowing the best pair of housekeeping genes to be chosen to normalize the expression of target genes. This application emulates a bulk analysis by observing differentially expressed genes, but in addition, it allows the discovery of pairwise genes differentially correlated between two experimental conditions. Researchers can download normalized data or use subsequent modules to map differentially correlated genes, perform conventional comparisons between experimental groups, obtain additional information about their genes (gene glossary), and generate ready-to-publication images (600 dots per inch).
